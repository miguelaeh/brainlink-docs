## What's BrainLink

BrainLink is an AI app store where you can find applications, agents, and tools.

Every user has a portable account - a brain - that can be linked to any app with a single click. These brains automatically provide the apps with user-paid inference, identity, monetization, memory, etc.
As a user, you can decide which parts of your brain to connect to each app as well as track data and spending across apps.

AI apps have high variable inference costs, which makes it challenging for developers, especially indie developers, to publish free or inexpensive apps.
Implementing monthly subscriptions adds high friction and the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) approach has security issues, limits the development flexibility, and is not user friendly.

At BrainLink, we believe AI should be like electricity. When you get a new app you just plug your brain and pay for the computation you consume, while the app can
monetize by adding some markup to your consumption or charging you per task completed or executed.
**Our mission is to make this process a single click for users and trivial to implement for developers.**
