## BrainLink Developer Docs

Integrating BrainLink in your app allows your users to connect their brains with a single click.
This allows you to get rid of the inference costs and provides your app with a simple way to monetize without paywalls or sign-up forms.

By integrating BrainLink your app is automatically listed in the BraiLink AI store, which is a powerful distribution channel and source of users.

We are devs building for fellow devs.

### Integrating BrainLink

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Register your application with BrainLink">
    > If your are still testing your app and have no public URL, skip the registration and use `5e476497-d7a1-4d27-8ad3-616210cf754d` as the app client ID. The user will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000` as callback URL.

    1. Create your own BrainLink account by going to the [dashboard](https://www.brainlink.dev/dashboard).
    1. Click on the top right menu icon and click on "Register application" under the developer section.
    1. Fill the form with your application data. If you application is a desktop app, the callback URL should point to localhost.
    For the callback URL, if you don't plan to redirect the user to a specific page after connecting their account, just provide the base URL of the application.
    In most of the cases, it matches the application website URL.
    1. Copy the application client ID that is shown after the registration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="For React based frameworks like Next.js">
    If you are using React based frameworks like Next.js, you can directly import the BrainLink button:

    ```javascript
    import * as BrainLink from "@brainlink/spa-sdk";
    import BrainLinkButton from "@brainlink/react-button";
    ...
    // Use the button on your app
    <BrainLinkButton appClientId="your-brainlink-app-client-id" />
    ...
    // Get the user access token to run inference (see next below)
    const userAccessToken = await BrainLink.getUserToken();
    ```

    To see complete examples for different frameworks see our [examples repository](https://github.com/miguelaeh/brainlink-examples).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="For the rest">
    You can also import the BrainLink SDK script directly:
    ```html
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@brainlink/spa-sdk/dist/index.js" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
    ```

    Then, create a button and set as the `on-click` attribute the `BrainLink.startCodeExchange(appClientId, appCallbackUrl);` method.
    The application client ID must be the one you generated in the previous step and the callback URL is optional. You just need to provide a callback URL if you want
    the user to be redirected to a different page after connecting his BrainLink account, otherwise, it will remain on the same page.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

And that's all! Now your users will pay for the inference they consume by connecting their BrainLink account with your application in one click, so you don't have
to request them API keys.

### Running inference

BrainLink's API is fully OpenAI compatible, so you can directly use the OpenAI SDK or any other compatible one, just change the `baseURL` to `https://www.brainlink.dev/api/v1`.

For example:

```javascript
if (BrainLink.isConnected()) {
    const userAccessToken = await BrainLink.getUserToken();
    const openai = new OpenAI({
        baseURL: "https://www.brainlink.dev/api/v1",
        apiKey: userAccessToken,
        // Required to use the OpenAI SDK in the browser.
        // Since your app is securely using the user's access token via BrainLink, it's totally safe to use the SDK on the browser.
        dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
    });
}

const completion = await openai?.chat.completions.create({
    model: "google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05:free",
    messages: messages,
});
```
