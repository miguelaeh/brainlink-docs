## BrainLink Developer Docs

Integrating BrainLink in your application allows your users to pay for their own AI spending by connecting their BrainLink account
to your application with a single click.

Traditionally, most AI applications have requested users to copy/paste theit API keys from other providers, however, that
practise generates a huge amount of friction to your application, goes against most AI providers' terms of service and creates important security issues.

### Integrating BrainLink

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Register your application with BrainLink">
    Create your own BrainLink account by going to the [dashboard](https://www.brainlink.dev/dashboard).
    Click on the top right menu icon and click on "Register application" under the developer section.
    Fill the form with the data with your application data. If you have not yet deployed your application, you can use `http://localhost:3000` on the URLs to test
    your integration locally. Otherwise, provide the actual application URL.
    For the callback URL, if you don't plan to redirect the user to a specific page after connecting their account, just provide the base URL of the application.
    In most of the cases, it matches the application website URL.
    Copy the application client ID that is shown after the registration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="For React based frameworks like Next.js">
    If you are using React based frameworks like Next.js, you can directly import the BrainLink button as explained on the [main website](https://www.brainlink.dev/developers).
    To see complete examples for different frameworks see our [examples repository](https://github.com/miguelaeh/brainlink-examples).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="For the rest">
    If you are using other type of framework or pure HTML/CSS/Javascript, import the BrainLink SDK script:
    ```html
    <Script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@brainlink/spa-sdk/dist/index.js" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
    ```

    Then, create a button and set as the `on-click` attribute the `BrainLink.startCodeExchange(appClientId, appCallbackUrl);` method.
    The application client ID must be the one you generated in the previous step and the callback URL is optional. You just need to provide a callback URL if you want
    the user to be redirected to a different page after connecting his BrainLink account, otherwise, it will remain on the same page.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

And that's all! Now your users will pay for the inference they consume by connecting their BrainLink account with your application in one click, so you don't have
to request them API keys.
