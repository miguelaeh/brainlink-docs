# BrainLink OAuth

At BrainLink we use a secure OAuth workflow to provider your application with user's access and refresh tokens that you can use to run inference via our model proxy.

BrainLink supports 300+ models through an OpenAI compatible API. This means the changes required in your code are minimal.

OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and other AI providers do not support a "Sign In with OpenAI" like functionality. Thus, BrainLink creates a layer on top of
them to help applications get more users by reducing the onboarding friction.

To get started integrating BrainLink on your AI application go to the [Quickstart guide](/developers/quickstart).
